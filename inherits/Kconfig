	  The cve-check class looks for known CVEs (Common
	  Vulnerabilities and Exposures) while building with BitBake.

config HAS_INHERIT_RM_WORK
	bool
	prompt "Inherit rm_work"
	help
	  The rm_work class supports deletion of temporary workspace,
	  which can ease your hard drive demands during builds.

	  The OpenEmbedded build system can use a substantial amount of
	  disk space during the build process. A portion of this space
	  is the work files under the ${TMPDIR}/work directory for each
	  recipe. Once the build system generates the packages for a
	  recipe, the work files for that recipe are no longer needed.
	  However, by default, the build system preserves these files
	  for inspection and possible debugging purposes. If you would
	  rather have these files deleted to save disk space as the
	  build progresses, you can enable rm_work.
