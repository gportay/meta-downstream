	  As of the 4.1 release, the ssh-server-dropbear feature also
	  recommends the openssh-sftp-server package, which by default
	  will be pulled into the image. This is because recent versions
	  of the OpenSSH scp client now use the SFTP protocol, and thus
	  require an SFTP server to be present to connect to.

	  Makes an image suitable for development (e.g. allows root
	  logins, logins without passwords —including root ones, and
	  enables post-installation logging). See the
	  allow-empty-password, allow-root-login, empty-root-password,
	  and post-install-logging features in this list for additional
	  information.

config HAS_IMAGE_FEATURE_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD
	bool "Enable allow-empty-password"

	  Allows Dropbear and OpenSSH to accept logins from accounts
	  having an empty password string.

config HAS_IMAGE_FEATURE_EMPTY_ROOT_PASSWORD
	bool "Enable empty-root-password"
	default y
	help
	  This feature or debug-tweaks is required if you want to allow
	  root login with an empty password. If these features are not
	  present in IMAGE_IMAGE_FEATURES, a non-empty password is forced in
	  /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow if such files exist.

	  Note: empty-root-password doesn’t set an empty root password
	  by itself. You get an initial empty root password thanks to
	  the base-passwd and shadow recipes, and the presence of
	  empty-root-password or debug-tweaks just disables the
	  mechanism which forces an non-empty password for the root
	  user.
