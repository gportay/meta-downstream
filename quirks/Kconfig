	help
	  Since Skyhead (5.1), WORKDIR references in other recipes need
	  auditing. If they reference files from SRC_URI, they likely
	  need changing to UNPACKDIR. These are commonly in do_compile
	  and do_install for things like service or configuration files.
	  One unusual case is ${WORKDIR}/${BP} which should probably be
	  set to ${S}.

	  References to ../ in LIC_FILES_CHKSUM or elsewhere may need
	  changing to UNPACKDIR. References to WORKDIR in sed commands
	  are usually left as they are.
